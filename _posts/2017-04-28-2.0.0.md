## What's up ?

We are happy to announce the release of CapiTainS Guidelines 2.0.0. The main event behind this is the release of a 7 months long run and a 
major change for myself as the main developer behind the CapiTainS suite. CapiTainS has now been an organization pushed by both the Chair 
of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig and Tufts University through both Perseus and Perseids projects.

If you were wonderings, texts following the guidelines of CapiTainS represents currently the following numbers (As of April, 28th. 2017) with its main known repositories: 

| Repository                                        | Texts | Total (Words) | Ancient Greek | Latin     | English   | German  | French | Unknown |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|

Which sums up to a wonderful **46 millions** tokens large corpus.

## Changes, New directions, future

### Changes

The CapiTainS organization decided to go wider than just Citable Text Services and it led to a complete rework of the python software suite that we developed. This decision was driven by the simple observation that CTS does not match everyones need and will probably never do. As such, we asked ourselves : what's the goal of CapiTainS ? The goal of CapiTainS is to offer to any one the ability to :
#
- serve texts through API and User Interface without having to care too much about producing the API. This is why, even though you could build you own interface, Nautilus remains an excellent piece of software to serve your text according to good standards,
- browse texts and collections from a Command Line Interface, reuse text in "local" studies such as Named Entity tagging or corpus linguistic
- help people to reuse texts produce by other in other contexts

The new CapiTainS is essentially upgraded to match this. Unfortunately, we did not have the time to improve the Javascript library Sparrow and we take the chance in this blog post to call for anyone willing to apply the same changes we did to MyCapytain to Sparrow. CapiTainS Sparrow is looking for a developer to help it evolve along CapiTainS !



## Then, let's go down to business : the softwares and guidelines' update

### Guidelines 2.0.0

The guidelines have been updated to take into account two changes that felt needed in a web 3.0 world and in a philological world : we added the `<structured-metadata>` node to every collection-level node (textgroup, work, version). This [node](http://purl.org/capitains/ns/1.0#structured-metadata) allows for expressing triple whose subject is the collection described ! Isn't it wonderful ?

The second and thired node are something we discussed for a long time and facing the need of one of OpenGreekAndLatin repositories we decided to add : `cts:commentary` and its child `cts:about`. While this is not part of the CTS Scheme originally, this allows to produce, in the context of a CTS URN, a commentary text which is linked to the text it talks about through the `cts:about` link. 

You can checkout the [examples in the guidelines ](http://capitains.org/pages/guidelines)
